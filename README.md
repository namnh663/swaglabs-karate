### Overview

### For simple script
```
# css selector: input[name=username]
# xpath: //input[@name='username']

Scenario: Login website

Given url 'https://myurl.com'
When input('input[name=username]', 'namnh')
And input('input[name=pass]', 123456)
And click('button[name=login]')
Then waitForUrl('https://homepage.com')
```

### Wildcard Locators
The "`{}`" and "`{^}`" locator-prefixes are designed to make finding an HTML element by text content super-easy. You will typically also match against a specific HTML tag (which is preferred, and faster at run-time). But even if you use "`{*}`" (or "`{}`" which is the equivalent short-cut) to match any tag, you are selecting based on what the user sees on the page.

When you use CSS and XPath, you need to understand the internal CSS class-names and XPath structure of the page. But when you use the visible text-content, for example the text within a `<button>` or hyperlink `<a>`, performing a "selection" can be far easier. And this kind of locator is likely to be more stable and resistant to cosmetic changes to the underlying HTML.

You have the option to adjust the "scope" of the match, and here are examples:

The Maven tradition is to have non-Java source files in a separate `src/test/resources` folder structure - but we recommend that you keep them side-by-side with your `*.java` files. When you have a large and complex project, you will end up with a few data files (e.g. `*.js`, `*.json`) as well and it is much more convenient to see the `*.java` and `*.feature` files and all related artifacts in the same place.

A Karate test script has the file extension `.feature` which is the standard followed by Cucumber.

### Run With Command Line
Normally in dev mode, you will use your IDE to run a `*.feature` file directly or via the companion **runner** JUnit Java class. When you have a **runner** class in place, it would be possible to run it from the command-line as well.

```
mvn test -Dkarate.env=test -Dtest=Runner
```

### Test Reports
I use reports generated by the Karate
